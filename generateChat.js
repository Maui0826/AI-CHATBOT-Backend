It is one of the largest and most recognized public high schools in the city, offering education for Special Education, Junior High School (Grades 7-10), and sometimes Senior High School (Grades 11-12), depending on the specific campus or program.
  
  HISTORY:
  Valenzuela National High School, originally known as Valenzuela Municipal High School, traces its roots back to 1968 when Maysan Barrio High School was established through the initiative of Mayor Geronimo S. Angeles. By 1969, other barrio high schools in Marulas, Malinta, Gen. T. de Leon, and Polo were also founded. That same year, these schools were unified under the Valenzuela Municipal High School, with Mrs. Josefina A. Lizaso as the first principal.
  
  Due to the growing student population, additional annexes were opened in Lawang Bato, Canumay, and Caruhatan between 1970 and 1972. In 1975, leadership passed to Mrs. Filipina M. Tetangco, and the main office was transferred to the Marulas Annex.
  
  Significant developments followed in the 1980s:
  
  Several annexes were relocated to new sites.
  
  In 1988, the school was nationalized and became Valenzuela National High School (VNHS).
  
  From the late 1980s to the 2000s, leadership changed several times, and more annexes were created to serve Valenzuela’s growing youth population. Many annexes eventually became independent national high schools.
  
  In 1996, ValNat launched a Science-Oriented Experimental Class (SOEC) to support students with advanced Math and Science talents, which ran until 2006. Later, Special Education classes and the Science and Technology Engineering Program (STEP) were also introduced.
  
  The school adapted to educational reforms, including the K to 12 Basic Education Program in 2012. In 2014, Mr. Filmore R. Caballero became the 6th principal.
  
  Today, ValNat continues to thrive with its commitment to providing real-life, quality education, guided by its mantra: "Learn Life @ ValNat, your gateway to quality life."

  **Early Beginnings (1968-1975):**
  
  *   **1968: The Seed is Planted:** The story begins with the establishment of *Maysan Barrio High School* through the initiative of then-Mayor Geronimo S. Angeles. This was a response to the growing need for secondary education in the local communities.
  *   **1969: Expansion and Unification:** Recognizing the need for more accessible education, barrio high schools in Marulas, Malinta, Gen. T. de Leon, and Polo were also founded.  These separate schools were then unified under the name **Valenzuela Municipal High School**. Mrs. Josefina A. Lizaso was appointed as the first principal, tasked with guiding the newly formed institution.
  *   **1970-1972: Growing to Meet Demand:** As the student population increased, Valenzuela Municipal High School opened annexes in Lawang Bato, Canumay, and Caruhatan to accommodate more students.
  *   **1975: Leadership Change:** Mrs. Filipina M. Tetangco took over as principal, and the main office was moved to the Marulas Annex.
  
  **Growth and Development (1980s - 2000s):**
  
  *   **The 1980s: Relocation and Reorganization:** Several annexes were relocated to better serve their communities. This period likely involved addressing logistical challenges and ensuring adequate facilities.
  *   **1988: Nationalization - Valenzuela National High School is Born:** A significant milestone occurred when the school was nationalized, officially becoming **Valenzuela National High School (VNHS)**. This likely brought increased resources and standardized curriculum.
  *   **Late 1980s - 2000s: Continued Expansion and Annex Independence:** During this period, there were several changes in leadership.  To address the continuing growth in the student population, more annexes were created. Importantly, many of these annexes eventually became independent national high schools in their own right, demonstrating ValNat's role in expanding secondary education in Valenzuela.
  
  **Modern Era (2000s - Present):**
  
  *   **Specialized Programs:** In 1996, ValNat launched a Science-Oriented Experimental Class (SOEC) designed for students with exceptional aptitude in math and science (this ran until 2006). Later, the school introduced Special Education (SPED) classes to cater to students with diverse learning needs, and the Science and Technology Engineering Program (STEP) to further enhance STEM education.
  *   **Adapting to Educational Reforms:** ValNat embraced educational reforms, including the implementation of the K to 12 Basic Education Program in 2012, which added Senior High School (Grades 11 and 12).
  *    Mr. Filmore R. Caballero became the 6th principal in 2014.
  *    Christopher J. Delino, PhD bacame the principal after Mr. Filmore R. Caballero.
  *    Ma. Christina C. Salonga, PhD is the current principal. 
  *   **Present Day:** Valenzuela National High School continues to be a prominent educational institution in Valenzuela City, committed to providing quality education and preparing students for future success. Its guiding mantra is "Learn Life @ ValNat, your gateway to quality life."
  
  In summary, ValNat has evolved from a small collection of barrio high schools to a large and established national high school, playing a vital role in educating generations of students in Valenzuela City. It has adapted to changing educational landscapes and continues to strive for excellence in education.

            text: `Choosing a school is a very personal decision, and the best choice depends on your individual needs and priorities. However, here are several reasons why someone might choose Valenzuela National High School (ValNat) over other schools:
  
  **Academically Focused Reasons:**
  
  *   **Established Reputation:** ValNat has a long history and established reputation as a quality public school in Valenzuela City. This can inspire confidence in the education provided.
  *   **Diverse Academic Programs:** ValNat offers a range of programs, including a well-regarded Science, Technology, and Engineering (STE) program for junior high, and specialized academic tracks (STEM, ABM, TVL) in senior high. This allows students to focus on areas of interest.

  *   **Preparation for College/Career:** The curriculum and programs are designed to prepare students for success in college or for entering the workforce after graduation, especially in specialized fields.
  
  **Community and Support-Related Reasons:**
  
  *   **Accessibility and Location:** Being a public school in Valenzuela City, ValNat is likely easily accessible to many residents in the area.
  *   **Affordable Education:** As a public school, ValNat provides affordable education, making it a viable option for families with limited financial resources.
  *   **Community Connection:** ValNat is deeply embedded in the local community, fostering a strong sense of belonging among students, parents, and staff.
  *   **Dedicated Faculty and Staff:** A dedicated and experienced team of teachers, administrators, and staff committed to student success.
  *   **Values-Based Education:** Emphasis on core values (Maka-Diyos, Maka-Tao, Makakalikasan, Makabansa) to promote holistic development.
  
  **Reasons Related to Opportunities:**
  
  *   **Extracurricular Activities:** A variety of extracurricular activities can help students develop their interests and skills beyond academics.
  *   **Potential for Scholarships/Financial Aid:** As a public school, students may have access to various government or private scholarships and financial aid programs.
  
  **However, consider these points as well:**
  
  *   **Class Size:** Public schools often have larger class sizes, which may not be ideal for students who prefer more individualized attention.
  *   **Resources:** While public schools are improving, they may not always have the same level of resources as private schools.
  *   **Specific Program Needs:** If a student has very specific needs (e.g., a particular sport, a very specialized arts program, a religious affiliation), a different school might be a better fit.
  
  **To make the best decision, consider:**

It is one of the largest and most recognized public high schools in the city, offering education for Special Education, Junior High School (Grades 7-10), and sometimes Senior High School (Grades 11-12), depending on the specific campus or program.
  
  HISTORY:
  Valenzuela National High School, originally known as Valenzuela Municipal High School, traces its roots back to 1968 when Maysan Barrio High School was established through the initiative of Mayor Geronimo S. Angeles. By 1969, other barrio high schools in Marulas, Malinta, Gen. T. de Leon, and Polo were also founded. That same year, these schools were unified under the Valenzuela Municipal High School, with Mrs. Josefina A. Lizaso as the first principal.
  
  Due to the growing student population, additional annexes were opened in Lawang Bato, Canumay, and Caruhatan between 1970 and 1972. In 1975, leadership passed to Mrs. Filipina M. Tetangco, and the main office was transferred to the Marulas Annex.
  
  Significant developments followed in the 1980s:
  
  Several annexes were relocated to new sites.
  
  In 1988, the school was nationalized and became Valenzuela National High School (VNHS).
  
  From the late 1980s to the 2000s, leadership changed several times, and more annexes were created to serve Valenzuela’s growing youth population. Many annexes eventually became independent national high schools.
  
  In 1996, ValNat launched a Science-Oriented Experimental Class (SOEC) to support students with advanced Math and Science talents, which ran until 2006. Later, Special Education classes and the Science and Technology Engineering Program (STEP) were also introduced.
  
  The school adapted to educational reforms, including the K to 12 Basic Education Program in 2012. In 2014, Mr. Filmore R. Caballero became the 6th principal.
  
  Today, ValNat continues to thrive with its commitment to providing real-life, quality education, guided by its mantra: "Learn Life @ ValNat, your gateway to quality life."
